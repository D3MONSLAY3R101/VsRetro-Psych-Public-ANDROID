Howdy there!  Aurum here :) 
Now, first things first, there are some things to note. This folder contains all the assets in the mod that have FLAs to work off of. Some things were made with other programs and as such, have no FLAs.

The assets that weren't made with Adobe include but aren't limited to:
 - Phase 2 Retro
 - Phase 1's Calm Sprites
 - Old Sakuroma's Sprites

Another thing to note, Minus Saku's Assets were exported as a texture atlas rather than a spritesheet due to the amount of frames and different sprites she has.

Lastly, many different people worked on all of these sprites, so the way some sprites here are handled may differ from others. The list below specifies who did what and their @ on twitter at the time of this txt file. Be sure to check their work out! Have fun with the sprites :)
